# About

**cccc** (*Chronological Corpora Curve Clustering*) is an R package designed to model, smooth, and cluster term trajectories over time.  
It supports the exploration of concept dynamics in scientific corpora through chronological curve analysis.

### Objectives
- Import and normalize temporal term-document matrices.
- Model word life-cycles using smoothing splines.
- Cluster temporal trajectories and visualize their evolution.
- Quantify conceptual shifts and knowledge dynamics.

The package is part of the [**RIND Project**](https://rind.units.it/home/), aimed at developing new methodological tools for research knowledge evolution analysis.
