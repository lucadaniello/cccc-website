## About

**cccc (Chronological Corpora Curve Clustering)** is an R package developed to analyze the **temporal evolution of concepts** and **semantic trajectories** within scientific corpora.  
It provides a comprehensive workflow to **import**, **normalize**, **model**, and **cluster** keyword frequency curves across time, revealing how terms emerge, evolve, and decline within a knowledge domain.

Rooted in the paradigm of *temporal scientometrics* and *textual dynamics modeling*, `cccc` offers a data-driven framework to study **conceptual change**, **topic diffusion**, and **knowledge transformation** across years or decades.  
It bridges quantitative linguistics, statistical modeling, and corpus-based research, providing interpretable tools for mapping **how science evolves through its language**.

## 🎯 Objectives

The package implements a full analytical pipeline structured around four key objectives:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**  
   - Import term–document matrices and corpus metadata from CSV or Excel files.  
   - Clean and harmonize lexical units.  
   - Automatically compute total frequencies and assign terms to **frequency zones** (linguistic or statistical).

2. **Temporal Modeling and Smoothing**  
   - Model word life-cycles using **B-spline smoothing** and **penalized regression splines**.  
   - Select optimal smoothing parameters through **cross-validation** and **generalized cross-validation (GCV)**.  
   - Visualize raw and smoothed trajectories to assess temporal stability or volatility of terms.

3. **Clustering and Knowledge Dynamics**  
   - Cluster term trajectories according to their temporal profiles.  
   - Identify groups of words sharing similar growth, stability, or decline patterns.  
   - Quantify **conceptual convergence/divergence** across periods and topics.

4. **Visualization and Interpretation**  
   - Generate detailed graphical representations of term dynamics, zones, and clusters.  
   - Highlight representative keywords and temporal peaks.  
   - Provide interactive and faceted visual summaries for interpretability and dissemination.

## 🔍 Research Context

The `cccc` R package is part of the [**RIND Project**](https://rind.units.it/home/), aimed at developing new methodological tools for research knowledge evolution analysis.
RIND is a multidisciplinary research initiative combining **computational linguistics**, **statistical modeling**, and **digital humanities**.

The methodological framework developed in `cccc` extends beyond literary studies:  
it is designed for **scientometric**, **sociolinguistic**, and **bibliometric** analyses,  
enabling researchers to detect **emerging themes**, **shifting paradigms**, and **the evolution of scientific discourse** over time.
