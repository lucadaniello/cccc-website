## Prerequisites

Before installing the `cccc` package, you need to have R and RStudio installed on your system.

### Install R

Download and install R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/):

- **Windows**: [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- **macOS**: [Download R for macOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
- **Linux**: [Download R for Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)

### Install RStudio (Recommended)

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that makes working with R easier and more productive.

Download and install RStudio Desktop from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

## Installing the cccc Package

Currently, the `cccc` package is available exclusively on GitHub. To install it, you'll need to use the `remotes` package.

### Step 1: Install remotes

If you don't already have the `remotes` package installed, run the following command in your R console:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
```

### Step 2: Install cccc from GitHub

Once `remotes` is installed, you can install the `cccc` package directly from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github("matildet/cccc")
```

### Step 3: Load the Package

After installation, load the package to start using it:

```r
library(cccc)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, please:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of R installed
2. Check that you have a stable internet connection
3. Verify that you have the necessary system dependencies for package compilation
4. [Open an issue](https://github.com/matildet/cccc/issues) on our GitHub repository for support

## Staying Updated

Since the package is under active development, you can update to the latest version at any time by running:

```r
remotes::install_github("matildet/cccc")
```
