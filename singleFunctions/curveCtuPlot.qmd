# curveCtuPlot()

Plot of Temporal Curves for Frequency Zones and Example Keywords

---

## 🔹 Function Definition

```r
curveCtuPlot <- (data,
                 ctu_noun = NULL,
                 r = 1,
                 themety = "light",
                 size_class = NULL,
                 x_lab = "year")
```

## 🎯 Aim

The `curveCtuPlot()` function generates a **temporal line plot of keyword frequencies**, distinguishing between **predefined frequency zones** (e.g., *high*, *medium*, *low*) and highlighting **three example keywords**, each belonging to a different zone.  
It supports both normalized and raw frequencies, with separate color scales for zones and example keywords.  
Each zone is labeled with its frequency interval, and the selected example keywords are displayed with distinct colors and a dedicated legend.

## ⚙️ Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **data** | List | A list containing the output of `importData()`. |
| **ctu_noun** | Character vector (length = 3) | Specifies three example keywords to highlight in the plot. Each must belong to a different frequency zone (*high*, *medium*, *low*). |
| **r** | Integer | Thinning rate for x-axis labels; displays one label every `r` years. Default: `1`. |
| **themety** | Character | Theme type: `"light"` (default) or `"dark"`. Affects plot colors and background. |
| **size_class** | Numeric vector (length = 3) | Defines line widths for the three zones. If `NULL`, default values are assigned depending on the theme. |
| **x_lab** | Character | Label for the x-axis. Default: `"year"`. |

## 📦 Output

Returns a **`ggplot2` object** displaying keyword frequency trajectories over time.

| Element | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **x-axis** | Represents time (years). |
| **y-axis** | Represents keyword frequency (raw or normalized). |
| **Colors** | Two scales: one for frequency zones, one for the example keywords. |
| **Line width** | Reflects the relative frequency zone (high, medium, low). |
| **Legends** | Two legends: one for frequency zones with intervals, one for highlighted example keywords. |
| **Theme** | Adjustable (“light” or “dark”) for improved readability. |
