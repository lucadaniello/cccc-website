# normalization()

Normalize Term-Document Matrix (TDM)

---

## 🔹 Function Definition

```r
normalization <- (data,
                  normty = "nc",
                  sc = 1000,
                  nnlty = "V",
                  p_asy = TRUE)
```

## 🎯 Aim

The `normalization()` function standardizes the **term-document matrix (TDM)** contained within the object returned by `importData()`, applying one of several normalization strategies.  
These methods transform raw keyword frequencies to allow for **more meaningful comparison** across documents or time periods.  
Depending on the chosen method, normalization can be performed **column-wise**, **row-wise**, or using **non-linear transformations** that account for asymmetry and variance.

Available normalization types:

- `"nc"` – column-wise normalization by corpus size (tokens per year).  
- `"nchi"` – chi-square-like normalization based on row masses and expected frequencies.  
- `"nM"` – normalization by maximum frequency per row.  
- `"nmM"` – row-wise min–max normalization.  
- `"nnl"` – non-linear normalization using asymmetry factors (variance- or mean-median–based).

## ⚙️ Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **data** | List | A list returned by `importData()`, containing the term-document matrix (`tdm`) and corpus information. |
| **normty** | Character | Type of normalization to apply. One of `"nc"`, `"nchi"`, `"nM"`, `"nmM"`, or `"nnl"`. |
| **sc** | Numeric | Scaling factor applied after normalization. Default: `1000` for `"nc"` and `"nM"`, otherwise `1`. |
| **nnlty** | Character | If `normty = "nnl"`, defines the asymmetry measure: `"V"` (variance-based) or `"M"` (mean–median–based). Default: `"V"`. |
| **p_asy** | Logical | If `TRUE` (default) and `normty = "nnl"`, includes the numeric vector `p_asy` with the asymmetry coefficients used for the transformation. |

## 📦 Output

Returns a **list** identical in structure to the input `data`, with the following updates:

| Element | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **tdm** | Normalized term-document matrix. |
| **norm** | Logical flag set to `TRUE` to indicate that normalization has been applied. |
| **normty** | Character. The normalization type used. |
| **p_asy** | (Optional) Numeric vector of asymmetry parameters, included only when `normty = "nnl"` and `p_asy = TRUE`. |
